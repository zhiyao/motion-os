description: Build motion graphics and launch videos in code, then open them in Motion OS, a local scene-by-scene review player where the user edits copy, pins notes on the frame, and sends one prompt back. Use when the user asks for a motion graphic, launch video, explainer, product video or animated ad, says "motion os", or pastes feedback that starts with "Motion OS feedback for".

# Motion OS

Motion OS is a workflow plus a local player. You build the video in code, render it, describe it in `reel.json`, and open the player. The user reviews it scene by scene, edits copy, pins notes on the frame, clicks **Send to Claude**, and pastes the prompt back to you. You apply it, re-render, bump the version, and the player reloads itself.

`SKILL_DIR` below means the folder this file is in (the player is at `SKILL_DIR/player/`).

## 1. Set up the project

```
<project>/
  reel.json     what the player reads: scenes, elements, copy, timings, assets
  video.mp4     the latest render ("src" in reel.json)
  assets/       images, footage, logos, music the user gives you
  src/          your motion code
```

Only ask for what's missing: what the video is for, length, aspect ratio, brand (colors, fonts, logo), assets, and a reference video if they have one. Defaults: 1920x1080, 30 fps, 20 to 45 seconds. If the user has no assets, recreate the reference's look so they can swap things in later.

## 2. Build it

- Recommended: [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev) (React). Keep every on-screen text, image path, color and timing in `reel.json` and import it in the composition, so most feedback is "edit reel.json, re-render".
- Any tool works if it outputs a video file (Hyperframes, HTML canvas, After Effects export).
- Never run `npm install` inside a cloud-synced folder (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox). Build in a temp folder and copy the source back.
- Remotion is free for individuals and companies of 3 or fewer people; larger companies need a license.

## 3. Render and check it yourself

```bash
npx remotion render src/index.ts Main video.mp4 --codec=h264 --crf=18
ffmpeg -v error -y -i video.mp4 -vf "fps=1,scale=320:-1,tile=6x6" -frames:v 1 sheet.jpg
```

Read the contact sheet before showing anything. Check text is readable, nothing overlaps faces or important UI, and audio levels are sane. Fix obvious problems first.

## 4. Write reel.json

See `examples/qbot-tag/reel.json` for a full example.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "acme-launch",            // stable, used to store the user's edits
  "title": "Acme launch",
  "version": 1,                   // bump on every render; the player reloads when it changes
  "path": "/abs/path/to/project", // shown in the prompt so you know where to work
  "src": "video.mp4",
  "w": 1920, "h": 1080, "fps": 30, "duration": 32.0,
  "reference": "Linear launch video",
  "brand": {
    "colors": [{"id": "accent", "name": "Accent", "v": "#5B5BF7"}],
    "fonts": [{"id": "head", "name": "Headlines", "v": "Inter Tight"}],
    "logo": "assets/logo.svg"
  },
  "audio": {"music": null, "bpm": 120, "drop": 4.0, "musicVol": 0.6, "sfxVol": 0.8},
  "assets": [{"id": "assets/logo.svg", "name": "logo.svg", "type": "image", "from": "User"}],
  "scenes": [
    {"id": "S1", "name": "Hook", "t": [0, 4.5], "els": [
      {"id": "headline", "label": "Headline", "t": [0.3, 4.3], "box": [20, 38, 60, 24], "src": "src/Hook.tsx:12",
       "props": {
         "text":   {"type": "text",   "label": "Text", "v": "Meet Acme"},
         "color":  {"type": "color",  "label": "Color", "v": "brand.accent"},
         "motion": {"type": "motion", "label": "Motion", "v": "Words blur in one by one"}
       }}
    ]}
  ],
  "notes": []
}
```

Rules:
- One scene per story beat. Scene `t` values come from the actual render and cover 0 to `duration` with no gaps.
- An element is anything a viewer might want to change. `t` is when it's visible. `box` is `[x, y, w, h]` in percent of the frame (use `null` for voiceover or audio). `src` is the file or `file:line` that draws it.
- Control types: `text`, `longtext`, `number`, `color` (a value like `brand.accent` links it to the palette), `media` (an asset id), `list` (with `cols`), `choice` (with `options`), and `motion` (free text, only you can change it).
- Keep scene and element ids stable between versions. The player matches the user's edits by id.

## 5. Open the player

Run this in the background (it keeps serving while you work):

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/player/serve.mjs" "<project>"
```

It prints the URL (port 4321, or the next free one) and opens the browser. If a server for this project is already running, keep it; it serves new files live.

Then tell the user, in two or three lines: click anything in the frame to edit it, press N to pin a note, the Script tab has every word, and when they're done, click **Send to Claude**, copy the prompt and paste it here.

## 6. Apply feedback

When the user pastes a prompt starting with "Motion OS feedback for":
- **Edits** (before -> after): apply exactly, in `reel.json` and the code.
- **Notes**: each has a timestamp, scene, x/y position, and the element and source file it sits on. Grab that frame (`ffmpeg -ss 12.4 -i video.mp4 -frames:v 1 f.jpg`) and look at it before deciding what the note means.
- **Links**: download them into `assets/`. Ask first if it isn't clearly the user's own file.
- Leave scenes marked "approved" untouched.
- Re-render, check the contact sheet, update `reel.json` (timings, copy) and set `version` to the number the prompt asks for. The player notices within about 3 seconds and reloads.
- Reply with a short list of what changed and anything you couldn't do.
